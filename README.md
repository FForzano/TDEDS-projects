# *Decision, Estimation and Distributed Sensing Techniques (DEDST)* Projects Repository

This repository contains three projects developed for the university course "Tecniche di Decisione, Stima e Sensing Distribuito" (Decision, Estimation and Distributed Sensing Techniques), held by Prof. Andrea Conti and attended in 2022.

Official course page: [Tecniche di Decisione, Stima e Sensing Distribuito - Unife](https://unife.coursecatalogue.cineca.it/insegnamenti/2023/49061/2018/1/10835?coorte=2022&schemaid=11454)

## Projects Overview

1. **signal-detection**
   - Investigates signal detection methods, including energy detection and thresholding techniques.
   - Provides simulation code, theoretical derivations, and supporting documents.

2. **MLE-based-location**
   - Focuses on Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) techniques for localization problems.
   - Includes simulation scripts, LaTeX reports, and related images.

3. **PCA-on-quantum-density-operators**
   - Explores Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied to quantum density operators.
   - Contains Python scripts for dataset generation and simulation, as well as LaTeX documentation and results.

## Structure

Each project folder contains:
- Source code (mainly Python)
- LaTeX reports and related images
- Simulation results and datasets

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Standard scientific libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
- (Optional) LaTeX for compiling reports

## Usage

Navigate to the desired project directory and follow the instructions in the respective README or documentation files. Run Python scripts for simulations and use LaTeX to compile reports if needed.
